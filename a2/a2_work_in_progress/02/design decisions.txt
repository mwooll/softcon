-1000 negative points? No, min is 0

Can remove single if a triplet is possible?
	• yes

-1000 hits even if i fuck up my turn with the next card

Fireworks, the most valuable combination is removed first

When a player reaches the win condition but then gets deducted oints and will not reach the win condition, the game ends anyways and the player with the most points wins

x2 does only double your points of this round



Branch coverage with assert not possible …
